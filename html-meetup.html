			<h2> html meetup </h2>
			<h5> June 3rd, 2023 </h5>
			<p> went to <a href="https://twitter.com/spencerc99/status/1662511055938158592">the html energy meetup in sf</a>. met some new friends and talked about websites and poetry and stuff. the conversation was meandering and light and we probably didn't write much html at all. i wrote a poem called <a href="yearning.html">"yearnings report"</a>. it wasn't a website when i wrote it. </p> 
			<p>it was one of the nicest days of the year and from where we sat, you could see the SF skyline peaking from behind the trees. every once and a while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_of_Saint_Mary_of_the_Assumption_(San_Francisco)">the cathedral in japantown</a> would catch my attention. it's strange contours capture the shadows in a special way. </p>
			<p>i've lived in sf for a few years now, but i can't remember the last time an event with mostly strangers felt so special. shout out spencer for getting such a wonderful event going! </p>
			<p> here are some pictures that i took and edited:</p>
