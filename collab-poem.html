			<h1> twentysomethings collab poems </h1>
			<p>in august of 2021, <a href="https://catherinethomswrites.com/">some</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/zoebodzas?lang=en">of my</a> <a href="https://www.elliemusgrave.com/#1">friends</a> <a href="https://index.niksethi.com/">and i</a> decided to make collaborative poems. each of us would start with a skeleton and hand it off to the next person to write an iteration. by the end, we'd have 4 versions of 4 poems. </p>

			<p> we had the prompt:</p>
			<blockquote>With each revision, make a copy in this document before adding/editing so we can see the progression! Feel free to add / subtract as much as you’d like — perhaps only a line survives. </blockquote>

			<p> here they are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="collab-poem/untitled.html">untitled</a></li>
				<li><a href="collab-poem/life-story.html">life story</a></li>
				<li><a href="collab-poem/my-roommate.html">my roommate’s been going back into the office</a>
				<li><a href="collab-poem/five-years.html">five years</a></li>
			</ul>
