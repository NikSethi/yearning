the dog downstairs has not stopped barking, 
ceaselessly, with the stamina of sisyphus. he 
must know something i don’t, like the baby
at the bar who looks a million miles beyond,
unattached to the taste of tiramisu, the torment
of the lover’s last kiss, before Hallmark cards
become bitter and isn’t the sound of paper
rustling and ripping so satisfying? the letters
no longer form words among the gashes
inside and outside this skeleton, no crew

the terrier downstairs is still barking, 

	ceaselessly, sisyphus gone dog. he 


knows something i don’t, like the baby

	at the bar who gazes a million miles beyond,


unattached to the taste of pub cherry pie, or the snare

	of the lover’s last kiss, before Hallmark cards


grown curdled and isn’t the thick certainty of paper

	ripping so satisfying? the letters


no longer leashed into words among the gashes

	inside and outside this skeleton, no crew

			<h3> by nikhil sethi and zoë bodzas and catherine thoms</h5>
			<pre>
the terrier downstairs is still barking, 

	ceaselessly, sisyphus gone dog. does 


he know no one hears? strive for unbothered, 

	like the baby at the bar unimpressed


by the taste of pub cherry pie, deaf to the ache 

	of a first lover’s last goodbye. 


a drawer of gnarled Hallmark cards

	and the terrier’s pleas go unheeded, his warning ignored


in favor of the gluttonous rip of thick paper,

	curdled and sick with fear. isn’t this freeing? the letters


no longer leashed into words that wield and score and gash, powerless

	inside and outside this skeleton, no crew

when the gone dog won’t stop barking
	i wonder if their turmoil mirrors
	that of the baby at the bar, though
		it escapes more ferociously than 
		baby’s unimpressed daze 

sisyphean, i consider not caring, 
	shutting out that ache, as dog tears 
	book with a gluttonous rip of thick paper
		that i should have thought about 
		before i left it in dog’s reach

though i am dog baby and book
	at any given point in the day 
	i am still curdled and sick with fear,
		enameled like a cherry in that 
		fossilized pub pie. isn’t this freeing?
