pick a new 
self to dissolve into
for a stretch
an extra soul
some set dressing 
good one, moon
i’m not a woman
just a mote on the 
curved salt lake 
of your eye
a floater
an understudy
there is a tide 
(there’s always a tide)
but looks like a gentle suggestion
to me

At blockbuster video
I am a new self,
a wildest-dreams self
dissolving for entire stretches
of time,

extra souls dressed
like asteroids, 
neither planet nor moon 
but orbital
all the same.

At blockbuster video
I am no longer a woman,

rather, a mote 
on the curved salt 
lake of your eye—


a floater, adrift—
an understudy
awaiting the fall
of a gentler,
more delicate self.

Blockbuster video and 
I go out with the tide
(there is always a tide).

better dress the set right
lest it reveal that i am
only a gentle suggestion 

no longer a woman
not yet a mote on the
curved salt lake of your eye

floating, adrift, and studying
the leaves as they rotate 
into their fall forms 

i, too, cycle out raw ruby, 
while pretending i don’t, 
among the blue spines at

Blockbuster video.
I go out with the tide
(there is always a tide).

At the dust-laden video store
I am the discus thrower 
swinging Blockbuster 
discs, perfect contrapposto

clear the mess, dress the set
to obscure the anachronisms
lest it reveal that i am
only a gentle suggestion 

no longer a lie
not yet a mote on the
curved salt lake of 
your eye or mine

a floater, adrift, and studying
the leaves as they rotate 
into their fall forms
the future and former

i, too, cycle out raw ruby, 
while pretending i don’t, 
among the blue spines and
the final shift at the

Blockbuster video.
I go out 
with the tide
(there is always a tide)
