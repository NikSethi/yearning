			<h2> my roommate’s been going back into the office </h2>
			
			<pre>
I don’t think I could ever live alone because I cry too much 
at stupid shit,
like the fact that the trash bags I bought don’t fit the size 
of the bin unless you stretch them til they’re close to tearing,
or the fact that 
a queen ant can lay up to 300,000 eggs a day
inside my walls, or
that no matter what I do 
I’ll never make as much money as a white male with an economics degree and somehow this
has become a laundry list
of this week’s minor crises.

(Another being that I don’t have enough quarters for two loads of laundry,
but we don’t need to go there.)

And honestly, 
I don’t know if having another person present would necessarily
fix any of these issues but 
I do know
that when I sink my teeth into a perfectly ripe, 
white peach from the farmer’s market
while standing over the sink because my shirt is,
stupidly,
also white,
I feel the need to manifest another person 
beside me so I can say

<em>Oh my god,
here,
you have to try a bite.</em>

I keep hearing that I’m 
supposed to cry at stupid shit
based on where the moon was
on the day I was born. 

I keep trying to stretch these 
mis-sized trash bag aphorisms over 
a plastic maw from which emotion
lets its stench emanate — 

I always take it personally 
when it doesn’t work —

Would that I were a white male
with an economics degree but
it seems to me that my garbage
can would swell uncontrollably. 

I wish the queen and her subjects
knew nothing about the white flesh
of a peach or of my elbow while I
am just fucking trying to eat dinner

sadly, just like my garbage can,
all they know to do is hunt

Still I feel the need to manifest. 
I don’t think I could live alone.
I need to be reminded that
contentment is as easy as

biting into a peach, and I watch
you do it, as you tell me,

<em>you have to try a bite.</em>

I wish I were less like the ant queen,
who pitches a palace in pink drywall
with loneliness potent enough to 
sire an army of infants, and 

I wish they knew nothing about 
the white flesh of a peach or of 
the well that we share within but
we all crawl around confused.

Still I feel the need to manifest. 
I don’t think I could live alone.
I need to be reminded that
contentment is as easy as

biting into a peach that
slices out solipsism until
all that can be said is

<em>
Oh my god,
you have 
to try a bite.

I keep hearing that I’m 
supposed to cry at stupid shit

based on where the moon was
chilling the day I was born, 

keep trying to stretch these 
mis-sized trash bag aphorisms over 

the metallic maw from which emotion
and its stench emanate,

always taking it personally 
when it doesn’t work—

I wish to be less like the ant queen,
who pitches a palace in pink insulation,

with loneliness potent enough to 
spill out a whole society of little selves, 

wish they knew nothing about 
the white flesh of a peach or of 

the well within that we share, 
though we all crawl around, dizzy.

No.
I don’t think I could live alone.

Need to be reminded that
contentment is manifestation, biting

into a peach that doles out 
solipsism until
all that can be said is

<em>Oh my god,
you have 
to try a bite</em>

and, antennae dancing, we do.
