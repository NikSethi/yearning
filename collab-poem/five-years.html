			<pre>
nearly five years ago he asked
if i liked to lose myself in the
middle of some certain fervor;
cut to a subway jump and a 
hitch in my breath and today
burns as bright as tomorrow 
once did on the undersides
of my tired eyelids 

there wasn’t much to remember
i am always thinking the best of
the worst elements and wishing 
what served me then would be 
enough today. the parity of the
two cats i shared beds and men 
with over the course of a year were 
stronger metaphors than their love

what conceit can we come up with
to fossilize frisson, to preserve the
feeling of maybe it will be good 
so it will last against the hard sun
of age and the unfair twist of grief
which rings our bedroom like a
coffee stain, like a black slug,
impermeable as your breath </pre>

roughly five years ago he asked
if i liked to lose myself to the
indescribable fervor; cut to 
the subway jump, a skip in 
my breath and today burns 
as bright as tomorrow once 
did on the undersides of my
tired eyelids 

i’m tired of remembering, i 
am always thinking the best 
of the worst elements and 
wishing what served me then
would be enough today; with 
two cats i shared beds and 
men for weeks and months,
a stronger metaphor than 
their love

what conceit can we come up 
with to fossilize frisson, to 
preserve the feeling of maybe 
it will be good so it will last 
against the hard sun of age 
the precipitation of pain, 
the inevitability of entropy
but the grip of grief rings 
our bedroom like a coffee 
stain, a black slug, impermeable
as your breath </pre>

i like to lose myself to the
fervor. cut to the subway 
jump, a skip in my breath, 
and today burns 
as bright as tomorrow once 
did on the undersides of my
tired eyelids 

always imagining the best 
of the worst elements and 
wishing what served me then
would be enough today, with 
two cats i shared beds and 
men and a calendar year,
the discarded days a stronger metaphor 
than their love

what conceit can we come up with 
to fossilize frisson, to 
preserve the feeling of 

maybe it will be good so it will last 

against the hard sun of age 
the precipitation of pain, 
regular old entropy,
but the low fog of grief rings 
our bedroom like a coffee 
stain, a black slug, impermeable
as the breath in your throat.</pre>

i like to lose myself to the fervor. cut to the subway jump and my breath skips because today burns as bright as 
tomorrow once did on the undersides of my tired eyes. it’s been a while since i tried to recall the best of the worst
that came before, but still i catch myself wishing that what served me then might be enough today. with two cats 
i shared beds and men and a calendar year, the discarded days a metaphor more lasting than our love. what 
conceit can we conjure to fossilize frisson, to preserve the feeling of <em>maybe it will be good so it will last</em> against the
hard sun of age and the precipitation of pain, of regular old entropy whisking us into the past.

and yet the low fog of grief rings our bedroom like a coffee stain, a black slug, impermeable as the breath in 
your chest.</p>
